## Deliverable 1
#### I've Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieving the nearest city to perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Furthermore, I've used this API to retrieve the current weather description for the listed city and thenI create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data. See Weather_Database.ipynb & WeatherPy_Database.csv files located in the Weather_Database folder.

## Deliverable 2
#### I've used user input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences and use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. These destinations were displayed on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. See Vacation_Search.ipynb, WeatherPy_vacation.csv, & WeatherPy_vacation_map.png files located in the Vacation_Search folder.
